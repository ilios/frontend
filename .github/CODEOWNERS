# Code Owners are automatically tagged for review of pull requests and a review from them is required
# before anything can be merged.
#
# We can filter by extension, directory, and other features too if needed
# Syntax and example: https://docs.github.com/en/repositories/managing-your-repositorys-settings-and-features/customizing-your-repository/about-code-owners#example-of-a-codeowners-file

# These owners will be the default owners for everything in
# the repo. Unless a later match takes precedence,
# they will be requested for
# review when someone opens a pull request.
