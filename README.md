## Open Source Heroes

Every day these for-profit companies make developing Ilios possible.  Without the free tier of service they offer to
open source software, ilios would be nowhere, so if you have a chance to pay them for something please do.

within the same directory as your Ilios Frontend code:

* `echo "ILIOS_FRONTEND_API_HOST=https://ilios3-demo.ucsf.edu" > .env`

Then you can start a local development server:

* `npm start`
* Visit your app at [http://localhost:4200](http://localhost:4200).
* Visit your tests at [http://localhost:4200/tests](http://localhost:4200/tests).
